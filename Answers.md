1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server side routing uses a server to show something to a user when they click on a link. The client requests a new page from the server, and the server sends the page to the client.  Client-side routing uses javascript to decide what to show a user when they click on a link. All the views get loaded when a user goes to the page, and if the client needs more data or different data, it can request it from the server without getting a new view. One of the main benefits of clien-side routing is you can avoid page refreshes.
